# 30-Day Machine Learning Engineer Challenge

This repository documents my journey over the course of 30 days as I follow a structured challenge to enhance my skills in **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**. Each day, I focused on a different topic, from foundational data analysis to building machine learning models. The goal of this challenge was to solidify my understanding of data science principles and tools, and to develop hands-on experience in real-world data problems.

### Overview

Over the course of this 30-day challenge, I completed tasks related to the following:

- **Data Analysis**: Working with popular datasets like the Iris dataset, Titanic dataset, and COVID-19 dataset to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and feature engineering.
- **SQL**: Practicing data manipulation techniques through SQL using the Chinook database.
- **Visualization**: Creating various visualizations using tools like **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to present data insights.
- **Machine Learning**: Building simple machine learning models using **scikit-learn** for classification and regression tasks.
- **Research and Exploration**: Reading research papers and exploring data science videos to deepen my understanding of the field.
